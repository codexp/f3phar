# f3.phar generator

This is just a generator for a `f3.phar` file which will contain 
the whole [fat-free framework](http://fatfreeframework.com/) inside.

This makes it very handy to deploy micro projects in no time with 
only a handful of files.


### requirements

- obviously functioning php cli
- your cli php.ini setting for `phar.readonly` has to be `Off`
- you need composer to install recent version of `bcosca/fatfree` framework


## install

First of all you need to install composer packages:

```bash
$ composer install
```

## pack

Then you can pack the whole fat-free framework in a phar:

```bash
$ php create-phar.php
```

## test

After you have created a phar, you may be interested if it works?

```bash
$ php test.php
```
